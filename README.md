## Credits

  In this application we have used many of the strategies taught by the excellent instructors at the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack coding bootcamp. We have used variations of methods taught in units 18, 20 & 21, which deal with MngoDB, React, Vite npm, the MERN stack, the Apollo server and GraphQL queries. Some of the boilerplate code has been copied. Finally, we copied open source badges from Vedant Chainani at the website https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk#contents

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
